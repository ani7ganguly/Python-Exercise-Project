#Answer the following questions
#Write (or just say out loud to yourself) a brief description of all the following Object Types and Data Structures 
#we've learned about. You can edit the cell below by double clicking on it. Really this is just to test if you know the difference between these, so feel free to just think about it, since your answers are self-graded.

#Numbers - store numerical informations - numbers and floats
#Strings - Ordered sequence of characters wrapped inside single, double and tripple quotes
#Lists - Ordered sequence of objects. Lists are mutable.
#Tuples - Ordered sequence of objects. Tuples are immutable.
#Dictinaries - Random ways to store variables with key value pairs. easy to grab. can't be sorted

#Problem - Can you sort a dictionary? Why or why not?


# In[20]:


#we can't sort a diectionary because it is not sequenced, rather it is mapping.

#Problem - What is the major difference between tuples and lists?


# In[21]:


#Tuples are immutable but Lists are mutable. Tuples use parenthesis but lists use square bracket.
